# Cisco Networking Labs

This repository contains hands-on Cisco Packet Tracer labs created to practice and demonstrate core networking concepts aligned with CCNA-level coursework.

Each lab focuses on real-world network configurations including VLANs, routing protocols, and IP address management.

---

## Topics Covered
- VLAN configuration and segmentation
- Inter-VLAN communication concepts
- DHCP configuration and address exclusion
- OSPF dynamic routing
- Switch and router configuration
- Network connectivity verification and troubleshooting

---

## Lab Files
Each lab is provided as a Cisco Packet Tracer (`.pkt`) file.

Example labs include:
- `Configuration 1.pkt` 

Additional labs will be added as coursework progresses.

---

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.x or newer)
- Cisco IOS CLI

---

## How to Use
1. Download the desired `.pkt` file
2. Open it using Cisco Packet Tracer
3. Review device configurations and test connectivity
4. Modify or extend configurations for additional practice

---

## Notes
- GitHub does not preview `.pkt` files; they must be downloaded and opened locally.
- Some labs intentionally demonstrate misconfigurations to highlight troubleshooting scenarios.
